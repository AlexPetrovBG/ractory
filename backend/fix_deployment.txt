Fix: Removed debug_imports.py file that was causing syntax error during deployment linting phase.

This file was causing the deployment to fail with:
E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax at line 1

The debug file contained a long one-line script that violated Python syntax rules.
Deployment should now continue successfully.
